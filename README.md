# Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
  
In this repository I learnt kaggle CVD dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).  
EDA was made and ML-model was trained.  
  
A detailed description of the task, visualizations and the course of the solution are presented in Jupiter Notebook.
  
Final metrics on whole dataset using 5-fold-cv:  
- **accuracy** = 0.8397;  
- **f1-score** = 0.8585;
- **roc-auc** = 0.8611;
