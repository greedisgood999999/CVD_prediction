# Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
  
In this repository I learnt kaggle CVD dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).  
EDA was made and ML-model was trained.  

A detailed description of the task and the course of the solution are presented in Jupiter Notebook.
